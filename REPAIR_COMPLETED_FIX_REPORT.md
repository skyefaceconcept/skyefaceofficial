## 🔧 WHAT I FIXED

The "Repair Completed" email was flagged as spam because it contained common spam trigger words. I've removed them:

### Removed Spam Triggers:
❌ **"Congratulations"** → Removed (overly enthusiastic)  
❌ **"File a Claim"** → Changed to "Contact us" (urgency trigger)  
❌ **"for free"** → Removed (common spam phrase)  
❌ **"immediately with photos"** → Removed (urgency/scam pattern)  
❌ **Multiple action buttons** → Removed extra links  
❌ **Emotional exclamation marks** → Simplified tone  
❌ **"Coverage" + "Claim"** → Simplified to just "Warranty"  

### Kept Professional Elements:
✓ **Warranty information** - Still included, just simplified  
✓ **Contact details** - Kept for customer support  
✓ **Care instructions** - Maintained for helpfulness  
✓ **Professional tone** - Made more neutral and direct
