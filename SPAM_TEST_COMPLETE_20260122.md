**Look for these 7 emails** (should arrive within 5-10 minutes):

## 🔍 What We're Testing

This test will tell us:

1. **Which emails are spam triggers** - So we know what to fix
2. **The pattern** - Is it specific words? Email length? HTML formatting?
3. **Consistency** - Do the same emails always go to spam or is it random?
4. **Priority fixes** - Which emails need the most urgent fixing?

---

## 💡 What Happens Next (After You Report)

Once you tell us which go to spam, we'll:

1. **Analyze the patterns** in those emails
2. **Identify spam trigger words** (like "Approval", "Action Required", etc.)
3. **Modify just the spam emails** - Keep inbox ones unchanged
4. **Re-send test emails** to verify improvement
5. **Repeat until all go to inbox** ✓
