## 🎯 What I'm Looking For

Based on what you report, I need to know:
- Which emails go to **INBOX** ✓ (keep these as-is, they work!)
- Which emails go to **SPAM** 🔴 (we'll fix these)
- Which emails are **NOT RECEIVED** ❌ (need investigation)

## 🔍 How to Find Emails

1. **Check INBOX first**
   - Look for subject line: "Update: Device Received"
   - Look for subject line: "Update: Diagnosis Complete"
   - etc.

2. **Check SPAM folder**
   - Gmail: Click "Spam" on left side
   - Outlook: Click "Junk" folder
   - Look for same subject lines

3. **If not found anywhere**
   - Check Promotions tab (Gmail)
   - Check other folders
   - Report as "NOT RECEIVED"
